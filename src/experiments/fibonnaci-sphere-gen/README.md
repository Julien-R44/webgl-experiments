# fibonnaci-sphere-gen

The creation of a fibonnaci sphere with some animations.

## Steps :
- Calculation of the vertex positions of the sphere
- Stereographic projection of the sphere 
- Now that the sphere is "flattened" we can build the triangles thanks to the Delaunay Triangulation.

And there you have your awesome Fibonnaci sphere ðŸš€
